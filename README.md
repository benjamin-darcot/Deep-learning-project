In the folder python_code are the different scripts used in this project. To run them, you need to update the path of the data in the scripts (in function list_files and for the saved model) and it should work after that.

The folder "model" contains 2 already trained model used in this project. These models was then used to recreate the mask layer by layer for each subject.

The file "Report" is the report of the project.
